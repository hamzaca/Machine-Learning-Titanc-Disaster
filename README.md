This project is inspired by the competition " Titanic : machine learning for disaster ", proposed by Kaggle.

Basically, the goal is to predict  if a passanger survives or dies in the Titanic sinking, using Machine Learning.


The algorithm used here is Decison Trees,  and the library is Scikit-Learn.

The training of the model is done on the data set train.csv.

Prediction :  prediction of the mortality of passangers in the data set test.csv.
